# Use of CUSIP Codes

According to FAQ section of [CUSIP Global Services](https://www.cusip.com/cusip/cgs-license-fees.htm):


>Can firms take CGS Data from public sources and create their own database without signing a license agreement with CGS?

>CGS Data is publicly available in some offering documents and from other sources. Firms can elect to collect this information and store it in their internal databases for non-commercial use, provided that the source of such information permitted the reproduction and use of such information. However, CGS's experience has been that the CGS data generally has not come from publicly available sources but rather from other sources such as a CGS Authorized Distributor or through improperly scraping websites of CGS customers with valid CGSâ€™ licenses. Most end-user customers of CGS Data prefer to enter into a license agreement with CGS for authorized use and to enjoy the benefits of the integrity and functionality of downloadable, timely and accurate data (either from CGS directly or from an Authorized Distributor).
